Potential improvements:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
   COMPLETED - 2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
2. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
3. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
4. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
   COMPLETED - 6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
